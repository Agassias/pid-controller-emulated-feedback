# pid-controller-emulated-feedback
This project implements a PI controller (Proportional-Integral) on an Arduino Uno. It controls a servo motor and an LED using an emulated plant – a first‑order lag that simulates sensor inertia. The goal is to demonstrate closed‑loop control principles without real sensors, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.
